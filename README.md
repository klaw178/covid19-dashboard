# COVID19 Dashboard

The Covid pandemic has generated a flurry of data, matched by countless attempts to visualise it in meaningful ways.  I thought it would be a great chance to have a stab at it. It is a applied and experimental interactive Python dashboard based on Public Health England data.

## Features
- accessing web-based APIs
- the JSON data interchange file format
- the Pandas data analysis library and its plotting capabilities
- building a basic Graphical User Interface (GUI) using iPython Widgets
- the Voila dashboarding tool for Python
